This is a Python library for the implementation of any type of
measures and comparisons of different types of fuzzy sets, as well as other important and useful
utilities and algorithms

## Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the `awesome-library` module in your project:

```javascript
const awesomeLibrary = require('awesome-library');

// Create a new instance of the library
const instance = new awesomeLibrary();

// Call a method from the library
const result = instance.doSomethingAwesome();

console.log(result);
